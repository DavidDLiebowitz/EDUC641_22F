### Weeks 5 - 7

Date: TBD

Topic: Summarizing and displaying continuous data

Objectives:

 * Describe the purpose and compute the following measures of central tendency: mean, median and mode
 * Describe and summarize quantitative data that are continuous
    + Includes computing the following measures of variability: quartiles, percentiles, inter-quartile range, range, variance and standard deviation
    + Additionally describe conceptually principles of skewness and kurtosis
 * Create visualizations of quantitative data that are continuous
    + Includes constructing stem-and-leaf, box- and violin-plots
 * Describe special features of a normal distribution
 * Describe distribution of repeated sample statistics drawn from a population and how this is informative to hypothesis testing
 * Apply CLT to understand whether mean value of a variable is different than a defined population value (when provided the SD of the variable)
   + Includes conducting single-sample t-test
