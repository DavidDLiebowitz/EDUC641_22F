## Unit 3

**Topic: Summarizing and displaying continuous data**

Objectives:

 * Describe the purpose and compute the following measures of central tendency: mean, median and mode
 * Describe and summarize quantitative data that are continuous

    + Additionally describe conceptually principles of skewness and kurtosis
 * Create visualizations of quantitative data that are continuous
    + Includes constructing stem-and-leaf, box- and violin-plots
 * Describe special features of a normal distribution
 * Describe distribution of repeated sample statistics drawn from a population and how this is informative to hypothesis testing
