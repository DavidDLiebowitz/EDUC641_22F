### 1. Introduction

(from syllabus)

(My suggestion is that responses identical to other people's words will result a warning for the first time, then zero point if this happens again; another suggestion is that we want to make sure that students render their html/pdf from Rmd/R file, so if not, cut some points. These may seem harsh in the beginning but will make sure student writing "runnable" codes as well as their own answers - two things that are fundamental to their success in later weeks)

### 2. Submission Requirments

For each assignment, please upload below two files on Canvas before deadline:  

 * An .html or .pdf file that includes both - 
   + your typed responses (in your own words and not identical to anybody else's), tables, and/or figures to the problems  
   + and the R code chunks that generated your answers (hint: in your Rmd file, set up echo = TRUE, include = TRUE)  
   
 * The .Rmd or .R file that you used to render the tables and figures in the above html/pdf. You'll be cut TBD points if the Rmd doesn't run or render properly.
