# Goals of EDUC quant sequence

- Develop the basic quantitative skills necessary to conduct applied data analysis
 + The full-year sequence (EDUC 641 $\rightarrow$ EDUC 643 $\rightarrow$ EDUC 645) prepares you to make valuable contributions to a research team
 + Not all the skills you will need (and not the only courses you should take), particularly for those interested in analysis-heavy positions, or becoming an applied quantitative doctoral-level researcher
 + Foundations of statistics, methods and data science

- Understand the (in)appropriate application of those skills
 + "Building a toolbox, not a cookbook"
 + Evaluate the credibility of published research
 + Understand the affordances, limitations and dangers of quantitative analysis

# Pedagogical orientation of EDUC

- Analysis follows research design that emerges from substantive questions
- Students learn statistical analysis by doing statistical analysis
- Start from an assumption of no prior background in mathematics, statistics or research
- Create an inclusive, supportive environment in which we learn from each other

-- 

.blue[Social conventions and schooling practices often convince some people, particularly women,  people of color and disabled individuals, that they are “bad at math.” We believe that quantitative skills, like any other skills, are built through regular practice, over time, and that all of our students can be successful in the EDUC quant sequence. We encourage all students, particularly those underrepresented in this field, to pursue the EDUC sequence and additional quantitative analysis courses in the COE and around the UO.]

# Goals of EDUC 641

We will focus on describing categorical and continuous data and quantifying relationships between categorical and continuous data. Students will form a solid foundation for frequentist, inferential statistics (and some of critiques of this model). The course seeks to blend a conceptual, mathematical and applied understanding of basic statistical concepts.

Concrete learning objectives:
1. Articulate the principles of responsible and ethical quantitative research
2. Describe, summarize and visualize quantitative data that are categorical and continuous
3. Describe, summarize and visualize the relationships between quantitative data that are categorical and continuous
4. Conduct a frequentist null-hypothesis significance test of the relationships between simple categorical and continuous data
5. Describe strategies to improve the replicability and generalizability of quantitative research
6. Use the R programming language to conduct all such analyse

# Features of scientific research

#### 1. Empirically based
#### 2. Systematic
#### 4. Defined sample and population
#### 4. Contextualized
#### 5. Reliabile and valid
#### 6. Disprovable
#### 7. Peer-reviewed

---
# Three facets to research

.pull-left[
### Design
- Where will you conduct research?
- Population of interest?
- Sample?
- Variables to examine?

### Measurement
- How will you collect data?
- Who will be observer?
- How will measurement be valid?
]
.pull-right[
### Analysis
- How will you process the data?
- How will you display results?
- How will you communicate findings?
]

# Kinds of statistics

### Often conceived of as...
.pull-left[
### Either descriptive or inferential
]
.pull-right[
### Either exploratory or confirmatory
]

--

### In fact, on a continuum

---
# Research design and statistics

#### This sequence focuses on statistics, but **research design** is AS (MORE?) important
#### It can be tempting to use statistical techniques to fix poor research design
- "You can't fix by analysis what you bungled by design" -Light, Singer & Willett. (1990). *By Design*
- Make sure you have mastered content from EDUC 612, particularly concepts of: 
 + measurement, internal and external validity
- Strongly encourage you to consider courses in advanced research design (EDUC 646, EDLD 650, EDLD 679)

# Types of data

```{r, out.width = "80%", echo=F}
  include_graphics("roadmap.png")
```

**How we collect and quantify the data informs the kind of analysis we will conduct.**


---
# Levels/scales of measurement

**What is measurement?** assigning numbers based on a set of rules

**Levels of measurement**: how categories/numbers are defined

Each type of measurement has a set of properties which determines the appropriate analysis.

--
### Four levels/scales of measurement

1. Nominal
2. Ordinal
3. Interval
4. Ratio

---
# Nominal scale

#### No hierarchy among levels of a variable
#### Levels are unordered, representing labels
#### A variable defining whether someone is an omnivore, vegetarian, vegan or fruititarian is on a nominal sclae

#### Most demographic variables are nominal:
- Hair color
- Race
- Ethnicity
- Gender

---
# Ordinal scale

#### Levels are logically ordered; a higher level indicates "more"
#### Distances between levels are not necessarily equal
#### Level 1 < Level 2 < Level 3 < ... (monotonicity)

#### Examples:
- Grades (A - F letter grades)
- Competition (1st place, 2nd place, 3rd place)
- Likert scale (on a scale of 1 to 10 with 1 being *very unhappy* and ten being *very happy*, how happy are you today?)

---
# Interval scale

#### Represents *quantity* and has *equal units*
#### Ordinal scale + equal measurement units
#### **There is no absolute zero**

#### Examples:
- The Fahrenheit temperature scale
 + The difference between 20 F and 30 F is the same as the difference between 60 F and 70 F
 + 0 does not represent "no temperature"
 + There is no concept of dividing or multiplying values on the scale. There are no ratios. We can't describe 50 F as half as hot as 100 F or twice as hot as 25 F

---
# Ratio scale

#### Interval scale + True zero point
#### True zero means a point where the thing being measured does not exist

Examples:
- Height
- Mass
- Distance
- Length of a piece of wood
- Test score (?)

---
# Levels of measurement

|          | Indicates difference | Indicates direction of difference | Indicates amount of difference | Has absolute zero
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Nominal  | X |   |   | 
| Ordinal  | X | X |   | 
| Interval | X | X | X | 
| Ratio    | X | X | X | X

--

#### Categorical variable
- Nominal and ordinal measures
- Use labels to describe

--

#### Continuous variable
- Interval and ration measures
- Data with arithmetic properties
