# Features of scientific research

#### 1. Data-based
#### 2. Systematic
#### 4. Defined sample and population
#### 4. Contextualized
#### 5. Reliabile and valid
#### 6. Disprovable
#### 7. Peer-reviewed

---
# Three facets to research

.pull-left[
### Design
- Where will you conduct research?
- Population of interest?
- Sample?
- Variables to examine?

### Measurement
- How will you collect data?
- Who will be observer?
- How will measurement be valid?
]
.pull-right[
### Analysis
- How will you process the data?
- How will you display results?
- How will you communicate findings?
]

# Goals of EDUC sequence

- Develop the basic quantitative skills necessary to be a research scientist
 + Not all the skills you will need (and not the only courses you should take)
 + Foundations of statistics, methods and data science

- Contextualize those skills
 + "Building a toolbox, not a cookbook"

---
# Kinds of statistics

### Often conceived of as...
.pull-left[
### Either descriptive or inferential
]
.pull-right[
### Either exploratory or confirmatory
]

--

### In fact, on a continuum

---
# Research design and statistics

#### This sequence focuses on statistics, but **research design** is AS (MORE?) important
#### It can be tempting to use statistical techniques to fix poor research design
- "You can't fix by analysis what you bungled by design" -Light, Singer & Willett. (1990). *By Design*
- Make sure you have mastered content from EDUC 612, particularly concepts of: 
 + measurement, internal and external validity
- Strongly encourage you to consider courses in advanced research design (EDUC 646, EDLD 650, EDLD 679)

# Types of data

```{r, out.width = "80%", echo=F}
  include_graphics("roadmap.png")
```

**How we collect and quantify the data informs the kind of analysis we will conduct.**


---
# Levels/scales of measurement

**What is measurement?** assigning numbers based on a set of rules

**Levels of measurement**: how categories/numbers are defined

Each type of measurement has a set of properties which determines the appropriate analysis.

--
### Four levels/scales of measurement

1. Nominal
2. Ordinal
3. Interval
4. Ratio

---
# Nominal scale

#### No hierarchy among levels of a variable
#### Levels are unordered, representing labels
#### A variable defining whether someone is an omnivore, vegetarian, vegan or fruititarian is on a nominal sclae

#### Most demographic variables are nominal:
- Hair color
- Race
- Ethnicity
- Gender

---
# Ordinal scale

#### Levels are logically ordered; a higher level indicates "more"
#### Distances between levels are not necessarily equal
#### Level 1 < Level 2 < Level 3 < ... (monotonicity)

#### Examples:
- Grades (A - F letter grades)
- Competition (1st place, 2nd place, 3rd place)
- Likert scale (on a scale of 1 to 10 with 1 being *very unhappy* and ten being *very happy*, how happy are you today?)

---
# Interval scale

#### Represents *quantity* and has *equal units*
#### Ordinal scale + equal measurement units
#### **There is no absolute zero**

#### Examples:
- The Fahrenheit temperature scale
 + The difference between 20 F and 30 F is the same as the difference between 60 F and 70 F
 + 0 does not represent "no temperature"
 + There is no concept of dividing or multiplying values on the scale. There are no ratios. We can't describe 50 F as half as hot as 100 F or twice as hot as 25 F

---
# Ratio scale

#### Interval scale + True zero point
#### True zero means a point where the thing being measured does not exist

Examples:
- Height
- Mass
- Distance
- Length of a piece of wood
- Test score (?)

---
# Levels of measurement

|          | Indicates difference | Indicates direction of difference | Indicates amount of difference | Has absolute zero
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Nominal  | X |   |   | 
| Ordinal  | X | X |   | 
| Interval | X | X | X | 
| Ratio    | X | X | X | X

--

#### Categorical variable
- Nominal and ordinal measures
- Use labels to describe

--

#### Continuous variable
- Interval and ration measures
- Data with arithmetic properties
