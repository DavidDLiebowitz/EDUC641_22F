# Independent Two-Sample t-test

* An independent samples t-test is a comparison of the means from two different groups.

* Enables a researchers to test for a significant difference between two groups.
 + e.g., Does the life expectancy of high-income countries significantly differ from low-income countries?

# Independent Two-Sample t-test

If our null hypothesis is `\(H_0: \mu_1 = \mu_2\)`, then `\(\mu_1 - \mu_2\)` should also equal 0.

To calculate our test statistic we use the following formula:

$$ t = \frac{\bar{X}_1 - \bar{X}_2}{SE} $$

Our standard error (SE) refers to the `\(\sigma\)` for the sampling distribution of the **difference in means**. This is a multi-step process to calculate.

Assuming there is no difference between our sample means (null hypothesis is true), our t will always equal zero. 

$$ t = \frac{0}{SE} = 0 $$

# Sampling a difference in means

Suppose we have two populations of students - &lt;span style="color: red;"&gt; students with infrequent school attendance &lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="color: blue;"&gt; students who attend school regularly &lt;/span&gt;.

On our standardized test, students with infrequent attendance have an average score of 95 `\((\mu_x = 95)\)` and students with regular attendance have an average score of 104 `\((\mu_y = 104)\)`. Thus, our true difference in means is 9.


Just like with our one-sample t-test, every time we sample each population, we obtain a new estimated difference between the two groups.

&lt;img src="continuous_indepen_samp_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-.gif" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

As we take repeated samples, the estimated difference in means forms its own normal distribution.

&lt;img src="continuous_indepen_samp_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-.gif" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

Just like the with the one-sample t-test, the &lt;span style="color: orange;"&gt; mean of sample statistics &lt;/span&gt; approaches the &lt;span style="color: purple;"&gt; population statistic &lt;/span&gt; with repeated sampling.

# Central Limit Theorem

Given two populations such that:
* The mean is `\(\mu_X\)` and standard deviation is `\(\sigma\)` for Population 1
* The mean is `\(\mu_Y\)` and standard deviation is `\(\sigma\)` for Population 2

...the sampling distribution of the *difference in sample means* is a normal distribution with a:
* Mean equal to `\(\mu_X - \mu_Y\)`
* Standard deviation equal to `\(\sqrt{\frac{\sigma^2}{n_1} + \frac{\sigma^2}{n_2}}\)` where `\(n_1\)` and `\(n_2\)` are the sample sizes.

Notice we have only one `\(\sigma\)` for both groups. This is an assumption of **homogeneity of variance**, meaning they share the same population variance despite differences in their means.

If we do not have homogeneity of variance, then we would conduct a Welch's t-test (a variation of the independent samples t-test).
---
# Estimating Variance

Since we rarely know the population standard deviation, we have to calculate a **pooled standard deviation** to estimate the populations standard deviation.

* Our sample sizes do not need to be equal.

* The degrees of freedom is represented by `\(n_1+n_2-2\)`.

`$$\hat{\sigma} = \sqrt{\frac{(n_1-1)\hat{\sigma}^2_1 + (n_2-1)\hat{\sigma}^2_2 }{n_1+n_2-2}}$$`


---
# Pooled Variance

Here are plots of the squared deviations in a sample of higher and lower income countries. Each sample offers an estimate of the population variance `\((\hat{\sigma^2})\)` by taking the average of these deviations.

Note: Our variances are different enough that the homogeneity of variance assumption is not met. However, we will ignore that for this demonstration.

# Pooled Variance

.pull-left[
&lt;img src="continuous_indepen_samp_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

`$$\color{orange}{\hat{\sigma}^2_1 = 50.73}$$`
]

.pull-right[
&lt;img src="continuous_indepen_samp_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
`$$\color{purple}{\hat{\sigma}^2_2 = 11.18}$$`
]

Our pooled variance is essentially the average of these, though we weight each estimate by their group's sample sizes so each unit (nation) contributes equally to the population estimate.

`$$\textrm{Pooled Standard Deviation} = \sqrt{\textrm{Pooled Variance}}$$`

---
# Calculating the Standard Error

All this calculation has been to find the standard error of the difference in means `\((\sigma_{diff})\)`, which is calculated from our pooled sample standard deviation `\((\hat{\sigma})\)` and sample sizes.

$$SE(\sigma_{diff}) = \sqrt{\frac{\hat{\sigma}^2}{n_1} + \frac{\hat{\sigma}^2}{n_2}} $$

The journey to finding the standard error was complicated, but remember:
* The standard error represents the standard deviation of our sampling distribution, just like in the one-sample test.
* The concept is the same, and it was only more tedious because we were sampling from *two* groups. 

---
# Test Statistic

Our last step is to insert our &lt;span style="color: blue;"&gt; standard error &lt;/span&gt; into our formula to find our test statistic (t-value).

$$ t = \frac{\bar{X}_1 - \bar{X}_2}{SE} = \frac{\bar{X}_1 - \bar{X}_2}{\color{blue}{\sqrt{\frac{\hat{\sigma}^2}{n_1} + \frac{\hat{\sigma}^2}{n_2}}}}$$
Fortunately, the numerator is much more familiar!

# Independent Samples T-Test

Null Hypothesis: Students with infrequent attendance have equal achievement scores to students with regular attendance.
$$ H_0: \mu_1 = \mu_2 $$
* Sample Sizes:
  + `\(n_1 = 12\)`
  + `\(n_2 = 76\)`
* Means:
  + `\(\bar{X_1} = 94.78\)`
  + `\(\bar{X_2} = 103.22\)`
* Sample Variance:
  + `\(s_1 = 11.59\)`
  + `\(s_2 = 10.26\)`
  
$$\hat{\sigma} = \sqrt{\frac{(12-1)11.59 + (76-1)103.22 }{12+76-2}} = 9.57 $$
Observed Mean Difference `\((\bar{X}_1 - \bar{X}_2)\)` = `\(94.78 - 103.22 = -8.44\)`

---
# Independent Samples T-Test
**Null Hypothesis:** Students with infrequent attendance have equal achievement scores to students with regular attendance.

$$ H_0: \mu_1 = \mu_2 $$

Pooled variance `\((\hat{\sigma})\)` = 9.57


Sample Mean Difference `\((\bar{X}_1 - \bar{X}_2)\)` = `\(-8.44\)`

$$  t = \frac{\bar{X}_1 - \bar{X}_2}{SE} = \frac{-8.44}{\sqrt{\frac{{9.57}^2}{12} + \frac{{9.57}^2}{76}}} = \frac{-8.44}{2.97} - -2.84$$
&gt; If the null hypothesis is true, what is the probability of observing a t-statistic of -2.84, or a more extreme value (degrees of freedom = 86)?

---
# Evaluating the Null Hypothesis

The p-value for a two-tailed test with a t-value of -2.84 and degrees of freedom is .006. 
&lt;img src="continuous_indepen_samp_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

Assuming the null hypothesis is true, the probability of obtaining a difference in sample means of +/- 8.44 or greater is .006. Because this is highly unlikely (p = .006 &lt; .05), we can **reject the null hypothesis**.

There is a significant difference in average national life expectancy between high-income and low-income countries (p = .006).
---
# Confidence Intervals
* Now that we have rejected the null hypothesis, what is the true population difference?
  + We don't know!
  
* Confidence intervals give us a range of values where we can be X% sure the true population value falls.

Example: We can be **95% confident** that the **true population difference** between high-income countries and low-income countries is **between 6.2 and 10.7** years.

---
# Visualizing Confidence Intervals

* Confidence intervals are just distributions built around our observed sample statistic.
* Reverses the process of null hypothesis testing:
  + What is the range of likely population values given we have an obtained sample value of X?

In our sample, we observed a difference in means of -8.44 between low-income and high-income countries.
&lt;img src="continuous_indepen_samp_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
---
# Visualizing Confidence Intervals

* Using the standard error of the difference in means, we can plot a distribution of likely population values.
* Here the highlighted region represents the 95% confidence interval of possible true population values.
&lt;img src="continuous_indepen_samp_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-15-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
---
# Calculating Confidence Intervals

* The confidence interval is just calculated as the sample statistic `\(\pm\)` the (SE*Critical Value).
* Critical value will depend on the degrees of freedom and confidence range.

`$$CI_{\text{diff}} = (\bar{X}_1 - \bar{X}_2) \pm \sigma_{diff}({CV})$$`
Here we can find our critical value. Our p-value here should be equal to `\(1-(\alpha/2)\)`.

```
## [1] 1.987608
```

`$$CI_{\text{diff}} = -8.44 \pm 3.09(1.99) = [-14.59, -2.29]$$`
