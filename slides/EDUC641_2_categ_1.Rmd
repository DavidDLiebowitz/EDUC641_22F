# The story behind the data

.pull-left[
- [Warren McCleskey](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/06/legacy-mccleskey-v-kemp/591424/) sentenced to death for murdering police officer during armed robbery in Georgia (1978)
- McCleskey appeals to the Supreme Court, arguing his death sentence is due to racial bias in sentencing...his appeal is rejected
- Senator Edward Kennedy sponsors the Racial Justice Act to enforce the Constitution's promise of equality under the law
- McCleskey executed in Georgia (1991)

# Goals of the unit

### We'll use part of the quantitative data accumulated by Baldus et al. (1983) to:
- Understand and implement principles of tabular data in R
- Describe and summarize quantitative data that are categorical
- Create visualizations of quantitative data that are categorical
- Write R scripts to conduct these analyses

---
# Materials

### 1. Death penalty data (in file called deathpenalty.csv)
### 2. Codebook describing the contents of said data
### 3. R script available ...


---
# Let's first access the data

Baldus, Pulaski and Woodworth (1983) compiled criminal justice and crude demographic information on all convicted murderers in the state of Georgia from in the mid-1970s. We have access to a simplified version of these data.

--

```{r, echo= T}
df <- read.csv(here("data/deathpenalty.csv"))
# it is common in R to name our datasets short names 
# so as to reduce typing (df for dataframe)

# Also, note how I can write anything I want after a # sign and it 
# doesn't cause any problems for your program. These are called  
# comments and are critical to remind youf (and tell others) what 
# you are doing!
```

--

#### but where did our data go?
---
# Understanding data structure

```{r, echo=T}
df
```

---
# Understanding data structure

```{r, echo=T}
names(df)
head(df)
str(df)
```

---
# Putting words to numbers
We know from our codebook what this long list of numbers means, so let's make our dataset a little more readable...
```{r, echo=F}
df$rvictim <- factor(df$rvictim,
                      levels = c(1,2), labels=c("Black", "White"))
df$rdefend <- factor(df$rdefend,
                      levels = c(1,2), labels=c("Black", "White"))
```
```{r, echo=T}
df$deathpen <- factor(df$deathpen, 
                      levels = c(0,1), labels = c("No", "Yes"))
head(df)
```

# Questions go with data

### What sorts of questions could you ask already of this data?

> Based on the contents of this data, what questions can you think of that ask you to describe single variables?

--

> Based on the contents of this data, what questions can you think of that ask you to inquire about relationships between two or more variables?

# Summarizing data: Tables
One powerful thing to do with data is to just count it up. How many defendants were sentenced to death?

```{r, echo=T}
table(df$deathpen)
```

--

> From the *table* of the values of the variable *DEATHPEN*, we conclude ...

---
# Summarizing data: Charts
Even more powerful is to visualize these counts!

```{r, echo=T, fig.height=4}
counts <- table(df$deathpen)
barplot(counts, xlab = "Sentenced to Death?")
```

--

> Sometimes, *proportions* are better ... can you calculate by hand the proportion of defendants who are sentenced to death? 

---
# Summarizing data: Proportions
We can also ask R to do this for us

```{r, echo=T, fig.height=4}
prop <- prop.table(table(df$rvictim))
barplot(prop, xlab = "Race of Victim",
        ylab = "Proportion of victims")
```

> After inspecting this *chart of the proportions* of the variable *RVICTIM* in our data, we conclude ...

---
# Another way to visualize
Let's start to get familiar with the beauty of `ggplot`

```{r, echo=T, fig.height=4}
rd <- ggplot(df, aes(rdefend)) + geom_bar() +
         xlab("Race of Defendant") 
```

```{r, echo=F, fig.height=4}
rd + geom_text(aes(label = ..count..), stat='count', vjust = -0.5)
```

> After inspecting this *chart* of the values of the variable *RDEFEND* in our data, we conclude ...
