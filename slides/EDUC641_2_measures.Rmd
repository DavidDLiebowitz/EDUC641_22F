**How we collect and quantify the data informs the kind of analysis we will conduct.**


---
# Levels/scales of measurement

**What is measurement?** assigning categories or numbers based on a set of rules

--

.blue[This concept is **critical** to quantitative research: we have some idea of a "thing" we want to examine (sometimes called a construct), and we need to figure how to turn the observed thing into a category or number.]

--

**Levels of measurement**: how categories/numbers are defined

Each type of measurement has a set of properties which determines the appropriate analysis.

--
### Four levels/scales of measurement

1. Nominal
2. Ordinal
3. Interval
4. Ratio

---
# Nominal scale

#### No hierarchy among levels of a variable
#### Levels are unordered, representing labels
#### A variable defining whether someone is an omnivore, vegetarian, vegan or fruititarian is on a nominal sclae

#### Most demographic variables are nominal:
- Hair color
- Race
- Ethnicity
- Gender

---
# Ordinal scale

#### Levels are logically ordered; a higher level indicates "more"
#### Distances between levels are not necessarily equal
#### Level 1 < Level 2 < Level 3 < ... (monotonicity)

#### Examples:
- Grades (A - F letter grades)
- Competition (1st place, 2nd place, 3rd place)
- Likert scale (on a scale of 1 to 10 with 1 being *very unhappy* and ten being *very happy*, how happy are you today?)

---
# Interval scale

#### Represents *quantity* and has *equal units*
#### Ordinal scale + equal measurement units
#### **There is no absolute zero**

#### Examples:
- The Fahrenheit temperature scale
 + The difference between 20 F and 30 F is the same as the difference between 60 F and 70 F
 + 0 does not represent "no temperature"
 + There is no concept of dividing or multiplying values on the scale. There are no ratios. We can't describe 50 F as half as hot as 100 F or twice as hot as 25 F

---
# Ratio scale

#### Interval scale + True zero point
#### True zero means a point where the thing being measured does not exist

Examples:
- Height
- Mass
- Distance
- Length of a piece of wood
- Test score (?)

# Levels of measurement

|            | Indicates difference | Indicates direction of difference | Indicates amount of difference | Has absolute zero
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| ?????????  | X |   |   | 
| ?????????  | X | X |   |

# Alternative measure terms

Categorical variable
- Nominal and ordinal measures
- Use labels to describe

--

Continuous variable
- Interval and ratio measures
- Data with arithmetic properties

---
# Four levels/scales of measurement

1. Nominal
2. Ordinal
3. Interval
4. Ratio

.red[**Why does this matter?**] 

--
Different scales contain different information and have different mathematical properties. 

--

Is someone who says they are at 8 on a happiness scale twice as happy as someone who says they are at a 4?

Is there a mean (or standard deviation) for the hair color of the students in this class?
