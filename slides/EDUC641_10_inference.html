# Class goals

- Describe special features of a normal distribution
- Describe the distribution of repeated sample statistics drawn from a population, how this relates to the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) and how this is informative to statistical hypothesis testing
- Determine whether the mean value of a sample is different than a defined population value (when provided the *SD* of the variable, aka `\(Z\)`-test)
- Conduct one-sample `\(t\)`-tests

# Life Expectancy Data

### Reminder of our motivation: 

Suppose you are working for the World Health Organization and are investigating life expectancy across different regions. 

&gt; Using this dataset, we can ask questions like:
&gt; * How does life expectancy compare in high- vs. middle- and low-income countries?
&gt; * Do individuals living in countries with more total years of attendance in school experience, on average, higher life expectancy?


**But**, before making comparisons between social/economic conditions, we want to start with describing our data. Let's say we *know* information on life expectancy about all the countries in the world, but we can only collect information on things like school experience on *some* countries.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

**Our second task:** .blue[How similar are these subset of countries' average life expectancy to our known "population" average?]

.footnote[[1] This is somewhat of a simplification. As we will learn, even if we had data on *all* countries, we wouldn't really know the "population" average; in fact, we almost never do and we are always estimating it]

# Normal Distributions

# Bell curves

You have likely heard of a frequent phenomenon that occurs when we quantify observations about the social and natural worlds: most observations tend to cluster in the middle, with others drifting out into narrower tails. You may have heard these described as "bell curves."

# Normal Distributions
The normal distribution is a mathematical function that is a particularly specified form of this phenomenon using two parameters:
* Mean `\((\mu)\)`
* Standard Deviation `\((sigma)\)`

It is defined by the following probability density function: 
$$ p(X|\mu, \sigma) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma}}exp[-\frac{(X-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}] $$
`$$X\sim N(\mu,\sigma)$$`
**The normal curve is a defined distribution of values that has several mathematically useful properties.**

&gt; "All models are wrong, but some are useful." - George Box

---
# Normal Distributions

A normal distribution is a **theoretical** distribution with the following characteristics:

Central Tendency:
+ The mean, median, and mode are equivalent values.

Variability:
+ 68% of observations are within 1 SD
+ 95% of  observations are within 2 SDs
+ 99% of observations are within 3 SDs

Shape: 
+ Unimodal
+ Symmetrical
+ Skewness &amp; Kurtosis = 0

---

# Normal Distributions

* All members of a population fall within the normal distribution (it represents the whole of observations)

* Any area under the normal distribution curve corresponds to a defined percentage of observations that fall within that area.

* We can always infer the percentage of observations in any part of a normal distribution.

&lt;img src="EDUC641_10_inference_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

# Empirical Rule
We can use our understanding of the normal distribution to calculate the probability of observing a value in a certain range. This is known as the **empirical rule**.

.pull-left[
A randomly selected observation has an approximately...
* **68% chance of being within 1 SD** of the mean.
 + `\(P(-1 &lt; Z &lt; 1) = 0.683\)`

# What is normal?

* A normal distribution can take on any mean and standard deviation.

&lt;img src="EDUC641_10_inference_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
* Regardless of the mean and standard deviation, the probability of selecting any particular value of that population at random always sums to 1.
* The empirical rule still applies (e.g., 68% of observations occur within 1 SD of the mean).
---

# Standard Normal Distribution

* The **standard** normal distribution has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
  
&lt;img src="EDUC641_10_inference_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

* The x-axis represents z-scores, meaning an observation's value represents how far it is from the mean.

  + A z-score of -1 indicates that an observation is 1 SD below the mean.
  + A z-score of +2 indicates that an observation is 2 SD above the mean.

* With a standard normal distribution, we can easily calculate the percentage of observations under any region.

---
# Area under the normal curve
Suppose we wanted to know the probability of scoring at least 1.5 SD above the mean on a standardized test of academic achievement. 

&lt;img src="EDUC641_10_inference_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
To answer this question, we just need to find the area of the shaded portion under the curve.

---
# Area under the normal curve
* We can either use some calculus or (more straightforward) a z-score look-up table to calculate the area under the normal curve.

&lt;img src="EDUC641_10_inference_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
--
Either approach would show the area above 1.5 SD of a standard normal curve is .07.

--

If the results of a basketball skills test fell in a standard normal distribution, then this would imply that 7 percent of all individuals score 1.5 SD or higher on this test.

---
# `\(Z\)`-test
Let's try it with our WHO data:
* Suppose that the population mean national life expectancy is 71.64 `\((\mu)\)` with a SD of 8.15 `\((\sigma)\)`.

* **Assuming a normal distribution, what is the probability of randomly selecting a country with a life expectancy greater than 76?**

* First, we need to standardize our value before we can calculate the percentage of observations above our z-score.

$$ z = \frac{76-71.64}{8.15} = 0.535$$

&lt;img src="EDUC641_10_inference_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;


---
# `\(Z\)`-test


```
##  z = 0.535 
##  one-tailed probability = 0.296 
##  two-tailed probability = 0.592
```

The area under the curve above a z-score of 0.53 is .30. Therefore, the probability of randomly selecting a country with a national life expectancy greater than 76 is 30%.

Using the WHO dataset, let's say we want to identify the mean life expectancy across all countries. However, let's also assume we only have the resources to sample from 10 countries.

Our **population statistic** represents the true value across all countries.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

Our **sample statistic** will be our estimate of the population statistic using the countries we examine.

# Sample estimates

* Assume that our &lt;span style="color: blue;"&gt;true population mean `\((\mu)\)` &lt;/span&gt; is 71.64. 

* Each possible random sample of 10 countries will produce its own &lt;span style="color: red;"&gt; sample mean `\((\bar{x})\)` or population mean estimate &lt;/span&gt;.

* These estimated means have their own variability around the true population mean.



&lt;img src="EDUC641_10_inference_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-20-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---
# Population v. sample distribution

If we sample our population **100 times** and plot the estimated mean of each sample, the estimated means begin to form their own normal distribution. The mean of sample means is our &lt;span style="color: orange;"&gt; **estimated population mean** `\((\hat{\mu})\)` &lt;/span&gt;.




&lt;img src="EDUC641_10_inference_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-22-.gif" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

The mean of our sampling distribution (mean of means) approaches the &lt;span style="color: blue;"&gt; population mean `\(({\mu})\)`&lt;/span&gt;. 

If we sampled all possible samples of size *n* from our population, our mean of sample means would be equal to the population mean.

---
# Central Limit Theorem

* There is a difference between the fact that many populations approximate the normal distribution vs. the normal curve of sampling distributions.

* Random sampling from the population **will return** means that will be asymptotically (approaching) normal in their distribution as the number of samples approaches infinity. This is mathematically what the Central Limit Theorem demonstrates.

* Because of that mathematical fact, we can conduct inference in the statistics.

--

.pull-left[
* Here is a histogram of the means of 1000 random samples from our WHO data.
 + The center of the distribution is our population mean.
 + The standard deviation is the standard error of the mean.

.pull-right[
&lt;img src="EDUC641_10_inference_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-23-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
]

Even though our life expectancy distribution is only approximately normal, the distribution of our sample means **is** (approaching) normal.

---
# Central Limit demonstration

See the following the link for more demonstrations of the central limit theorem:
{https://onlinestatbook.com/stat_sim/sampling_dist/ }

---
# Central Limit Theorem

&gt; Given a population mean `\(\mu\)` and standard deviation of `\(\sigma\)`, the sampling distribution of the mean is a normal distribution with a mean equal to `\(\mu\)` and standard deviation equal to `\(\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}\)`, where *n* is the sample size.

&gt; The distribution of sample means will approach the normal distribution as the sample size increases regardless of the shape of the population distribution.

* The sampling distribution of means approximates a normal distribution because it is estimating a statistic of the population distribution. It is not "recreating" the shape of the population distribution.

* Center: Mean of sample means is the population mean.
$$ \mu_\bar{X} = \mu$$

* Spread: Standard deviation of sample means is the standard error of the mean

$$ \sigma_\bar{X} = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$$

# One sample `\(t\)`-tests


---
# Population variance
* In a z-test, the population standard deviation is assumed to be known.

* In practice, we **rarely** know the true population standard deviation **even if we observe all individuals in our "population"** (e.g., all students in a state, all countries in the world). This is because:
  + Measurement error (e.g., we didn't measure how long everyone lived accurately)
  + Population statistics can be in constant flux (e.g., average life expectancies can change moment to moment)
  + There are elements of idiosyncrasy in each individual's realized outcome that might have come out differently in some other lived reality (e.g. Sliding Doors, multi-verses)
  + Can be unfeasible to measure entire population

--

Thus, we tend to use ** `\(t\)`-distributions** to make our inferences, because these do not require us to know population variability.

---
# `\(t\)`-distributions
* Assume that the *population* standard deviation `\((\sigma)\)` is unknown. Instead, it uses the *sample* standard deviation. 
* `\(t\)`-distributions with smaller sample sizes have "fatter" tails. Assumes more uncertainty with smaller sample sizes.
* Resemble `\(Z\)`-distributions as .red[**degrees of freedom**] increase.

---
# An aside on degrees of freedom

The .red[**degrees of freedom**] refers to the number of values in the calculation of a statistic that are free to vary. 

In the calculation of simple, one-sample statistics (e.g., the mean) our degrees of freedom are always `\(n-1\)`, where `\(n\)` is our sample size.

This is because once you know the mean and all but one of the values of the observations, the last observation must be a defined value:

&gt; `$$mean(71, 73, 76, 78, ??) = 75.4$$`
&gt; `$$\frac{71 + 73 + 76 + 78 + ??}{5} = 75.4$$`
&gt; $$ ?? = (75.4 * 5) - 71 - 73 - 76 - 78$$
&gt; $$ ?? = 79$$

--

In this case, therefore, our degrees of freedom are `\(5 - 1\)`; i.e. 4.


---

# Quiz

---
# `\(t\)`-distributions

* Likewise, the degrees of freedom for a `\(t\)`-test is always *n*-1, where *n* is our sample size.
* `\(t\)`-distributions with fewer degrees of freedom have "fatter" tails.

  
&lt;img src="EDUC641_10_inference_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-25-.gif" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;




---
# One sample `\(t\)`-test
* `\(t\)`-tests are one of the most foundational statistical tests in classical statistics.

* The purpose of a one-sample `\(t\)`-test is to describe the probability of obtaining a particular sample mean through random sampling variability, assuming the population mean = K.
  + e.g. Is our observed sample mean to be expected if we repeatedly drew random samples from the population?
  
  
**Example Research Question:**
Suppose the known average life expectancy is 76 years with a standard deviation of 3.2. Do countries around the Mediterranean Sea significantly differ from the known population average of 76?


---
# One sample `\(t\)`-test
*  The one sample t-test does **not** test the probability of obtaining the sample distribution or data itself, only the sample mean.
  
*  Using the probability of obtaining a particular sample mean **Null Hypothesis** `\((H_0)\)`: `\(\mu = K\)`, where `\(K\)` is any constant.


---
# One sample `\(t\)`-test
* With a z-test, we were able to find the number of observations that fell beyond a particular value. That value was our z-statistic.
* The t-statistic is functionally like a z-statistic, but for the t-distribution.

&lt;img src="EDUC641_10_inference_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-27-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;


---
# `\(t\)`-distribution
* Shape of the t-distribution is slightly different depending on the degrees of freedom `\((n-1)\)`.

* Thus, the proportion of the area under the curve beyond our t-value also depends on our degrees of freedom.


&lt;img src="EDUC641_10_inference_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-28-.gif" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---
# One sample `\(t\)`-test

* To calculate a t-statistic, we use the same formula to calculate a z-score, but replace the population standard deviation with the sample's standard deviation.

Since we don't know the population standard deviation `\((\mu)\)`, our samples standard deviation `\((s)\)` is used as an estimate of the population standard deviation `\((\hat{\mu})\)`.

$$ t = \frac{\bar{X} - \mu}{s/\sqrt{n}} $$

# Applying a `\(t\)`-test
Suppose we have data from a sample of 10 countries with a mean life expectancy of 66.87 and standard deviation of 5.82.

If our population mean is thought to be 78.16 `\((H_0: \sigma = 78.16)\)`, what is the probability of obtaining a sample mean of 66.87, **or a more extreme mean value**, due to random sampling variability?
`$$t(9) = \frac{66.87 - 75.16}{5.82/\sqrt{10}} = -1.24$$`

# Demonstration

* Dr. DSM and Dr. APA have developed a new intervention for depression.

* They would like to compare the post-treatment depression ratings for their research participants to average depression ratings following "business as usual."

* They conduct a one-tailed t-test to see if their sample's mean post-treatment rating is significantly better than the normal post-treatment averages.
 + `\((H_0: \mu &lt; K)\)`

# Demonstration

Dr. DSM finds that the mean post-intervention depression rating did not fall below the critical t-value for the one-tailed test. The new intervention group did not demonstrate significantly lower than normal post-treatment averages.
&lt;img src="EDUC641_10_inference_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-32-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

.blue[What conclusion was missed with the one-tailed test?]

--
The sample had much higher levels of depression than we'd expect! Neither the null `\((\mu = K)\)` or alternative hypothesis `\((\mu &lt; K)\)` seem tenable.

---
# Alpha thresholds and `\(t\)`-values

With two-tailed tests, the total alpha is "split" across both tails of the distribution.
 * If `\(\alpha = .05\)`, `\(\alpha/2 = 0.025\)`.

* Critical t-values `\(t_{\alpha/2}(df)\)` are the values at which our alpha threshold is met.
  
&lt;img src="EDUC641_10_inference_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-33-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

If we conducted a t-test, our t-statistic would have to be less than -2.2622 or greater than 2.2622 to reject the null hypothesis.

---
# One sample `\(t\)`-test

* Assuming we had set our `\(\alpha\)` at .05, let's see if we reject our null hypothesis in our earlier question: *do countries around the Mediterranean Sea significantly differ from the known population average?*

.pull-left[
Our observed t-value did not surpass our critical t-values.
&lt;img src="EDUC641_10_inference_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-34-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
]

.pull-right[
Our p-value is not less than .05 and does not satisfy our alpha threshold.
&lt;img src="EDUC641_10_inference_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-35-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
]

Whether we compare our t-statistic to our critical t-values or our look at our p-value, we come to the same conclusion.


---
# Interpretation of `\(t\)`-test

&lt;img src="EDUC641_10_inference_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-36-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

Assuming a population mean of 78.16 and sample size of 10, the proportion of random samples that would demonstrate a sample mean **equal to or more extreme than 66.87** is 0.24 `\((t = -1.24, p = 0.24)\)`. Because our p-value does not meet our alpha threshold of .05, we **fail to reject the null hypothesis**.

Thus, we can conclude that the mean life expectancy of this sample of countries around the Mediterranean is not different from the mean population average.

---
# Putting it together

1. We can characterize the central tendency and variability of any distribution with several useful statistics
2. The normal distribution has several features that allow us to state precisely how likely it is that we would observe any particular value under the normal curve
3. Statistics calculated in samples that are drawn repeatedly from a population will form their own distributions. 
4. Even if the population itself is not normal, the mean of sample means drawn from that population **will** be normal
5. As a result, we can test whether any observed sample mean is different from the population mean

.red[**Even if it's not apparent yet, these foundational building blocks will allow you later to compare two groups, characterize the relationship between two variables and more!**]
