# Life Expectancy Data
Suppose you are working for the World Health Organization and are investigating life expectancy across different regions. 

&gt; Using this dataset, we can ask questions like:
&gt; * How does life expectancy compare in developing vs. developed regions?
&gt; * Do individuals living in countries with more total years of attendance in school experience, on average, higher life expectancy??


**But**, before making comparisons between social/economic conditions, we want to start with describing the full dataset, looking at all 183 nations in the dataset.

**Our Task:** Describe the distribution of regional life expectancy in 2015.

---
# What is a distribution?

A distribution describes the number of observations of variable that take a particular value.

&lt;img src="continuous_l1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
---
# Visualizing a Distribution

Some of the most common ways to visualize a distribution are a:

* Histogram
  + Groups the data into "bins" and shows the count of observations in each bin
  + Can specify number of bins/bin width


```r
ggplot(who, aes(life_expectancy)) +
  geom_histogram()
```

&lt;img src="continuous_l1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
---
# Visualizing a Distribution

* Density Plot
  + Essentially a "smoothed out" histogram
  + Values reflect the distribution's probability density function (not essential to understand their calculation)
  

```r
ggplot(who, aes(life_expectancy)) +
  geom_density()
```

&lt;img src="continuous_l1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

# Describing a Distribution

There are many ways to describe the characteristics of a distribution. 

Today we are reviewing:

* Measures of Central Tendency
  + Mean
  + Median
  + Mode
  
* Spread or Variability
  + Variance
  + Standard Deviation
  + Interquartile Range
  + Range

* Measures of Skewness
* Measures of Kurtosis
  

---
# Mean
* Represents the **average**, or the sum of all observations divided by the number of observations.
* One of the most common forms of central tendency.
* Represented by the Greek symbol `\(\mu\)`.

 
&gt; `$$mean(71, 73, 76, 78, 79) = \frac{71 + 73 + 76 + 78 + 79}{5} = 75.4$$`


Writing this out can be a little tedious. Since our datasets can often have hundreds or thousands of observations, we often use **summation notation**.
---
# Summation Notation

Summation (or sigma) notation is used to provide a concise expression for the sum of observations.

`$$\sum_{i=i}^{n} x_{i}$$`
* i = index of summation
* n = stopping point (number of observations)
* `\(x_i\)` = summation element (what we are summing)

Our mean formula rewritten using summation notation:


`$$\bar{X} = \frac{1}{n}{\sum_{i=i}^{n} X_{i}}$$`

---
# Summation Notation

Let's demonstrate using our WHO data of 183 countries to find the mean.

&gt; `$$\bar{X} = \frac{1}{183}{\sum_{i=1}^{183} X_{i}} = \frac{13110}{183} = 71.64$$`

The mean national life expectancy in 2015 is 71.64 years.

---
# Mean
* The mean represents the "balance point" of the distribution.

* Outliers, or observations with highly unusual values, can affect this balance point.

* Thus, the mean is vulnerable to outliers.

---
# Vulnerability of the Mean
* Humans on Mars and Venus have very low life expectancies (for now).
* Here, having Mars and Venus in this sample of countries greatly shifted our mean away from the "peak" of the distribution.

&lt;img src="continuous_l1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---
# Median
* Represents the **midpoint** of the distribution.

* Also called the *50th percentile* of a distribution or *2nd quartile*, meaning half of the observations are above the median and half are below.

* Particularly useful for describing the central tendency of skewed distributions (more on this later).

* To find the median, arrange the scores in ascending order and identify the middle value. If there are two middle values (even number of observations), use the average of the two.

&gt; `$$median(71, 73, 76, 78, 79) = 76$$`
&gt; `$$median(71, 73, 76, 77, 78, 79) = 76.5$$`

---
# Median
* Unlike the mean, the median is less affected by outliers.

&lt;img src="continuous_l1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
---
# Mode
The mode simply refers to the **most frequent value** in the data.

What is the mode of the following data?

&gt; 78, 79, 78, 77, 80, 79, 76, 74, 79, 78, 77, 78, 80, 79, 78, 76, 79, 77, 78, 78

It's easier if we sort the data first.

&gt; 74, 76, 76, 77, 77, 77, **78, 78, 78, 78, 78, 78, 78,** 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 80, 80

78 is the most frequent value in the data. Therefore, the mode is 78.

---
# Mode

Sometimes there may be more than one mode. Consider the following example:

&gt; 4, 6, 6, 7, 7, 7, **8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9,** 10, 10

Both 8 and 9 are observed seven times. In this case, the data can be considered **bimodal** and both modes would be reported.

In general, the mode is rarely used and is particularly vulnerable to idiosyncratic patterns in the data.

---
# Comparing Distributions

These distributions have the same central tendency `\((\mu = 100)\)`.

How are they different?

&lt;img src="continuous_l1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---
# Variability

* Central tendency is only one component of a distribution.

* What if we want to know how much variation there is in life expectancy across nations?
  + How much does typical observation deviate from the mean?

* **Measures of Variability:**
  + Range
  + Interquartile Range
  + Variance
  + Standard Deviation

---
# Range

* Represents the difference between the highest value and lowest value in the dataset.
* Can provide a rough estimate of spr ead

&gt; `$$range(71, 73, 76, 78, 79) = 79 - 71 = 8$$`

* Very vulnerable to outliers. One observation can make a big difference!

&gt; `$$range(55, 73, 76, 78, 79) = 79 - 55 = 24$$`

---
# Interquartile Range (IQR)
* Represents the difference between the 1st quartile (25th percentile) and the 3rd quartile (75th percentile).

* **Percentile** refers to the percentage of observations that fall at or below that score.
  + e.g., 25% of observed national life expectancies fall at or below 66 years of age.

* IQR summarizes the range of "average" scores in the dataset.

&lt;img src="continuous_l1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---
# Variance
* Represents the **average squared deviation** of each observation from the mean.

`$$s^{2} = \frac{\sum_{i=i}^{n} x_{i}}{n}$$`

* Why do we square the deviation?

---
# Variance
Here are some national life expectancies centered around the mean. Their value represents their difference relative to the sample mean.
  
&lt;img src="continuous_l1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
Some observations fall below the mean so their deviation is a negative value. If we took the average of our positive and negative deviations, we'd just get zero!

---
# Variance
Since any number squared is positive, let's try squaring our deviations.

&lt;img src="continuous_l1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
Now we can take the average of our squared deviations and get a non-zero value!
---
# Variance

Our variance (or average squared deviation) is approximately 66.43.

&lt;img src="continuous_l1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

By itself, a variance of 66.43 is not very meaningful to us. It does not reflect the raw units of our original scale (it represents squared units).
---
# Standard Deviation

* If we take the square root of our sample variance, we can summarize average deviations back on our raw scale. 

* The standard deviation represents the **positive square root of the variance**.
$$ s = \sqrt{s^2} $$
$$ \sqrt{66.43} = 8.15 $$

The standard deviation of life expectancy in 2015 was approximately 8.15 *years*.

---
# Standard Deviation

Here is our original plot with our &lt;span style="color: red;"&gt;standard deviation&lt;/span&gt; plotted below and above the mean (i.e., -1 SD, +1 SD).

&lt;img src="continuous_l1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

The standard deviation of life expectancy in 2015 was approximately 8.15 *years*.

---
# Transformations
* A distribution can have any mean and any (positive) standard deviation.
* Sometimes it is helpful to standardize a distribution to a common mean and standard deviation so we can more easily compare them and identify extreme data points.

&lt;img src="continuous_l1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
---
# Transformations
* The most common transformation is a z-transformation. 
* A z-transformation rescales the distribution to a mean of 0 `\((\mu)\)` and a standard deviation `\((\sigma)\)` of 1.


&lt;img src="continuous_l1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---
# Transforming Distributions
* Any distribution can be standardized using a linear function.

Each observation is transformed into a **z-score** using the following formula:
`$$z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma}$$`

* A z-score is calculated by **subtracting the mean** from each value and **dividing by the standard deviation**.

* An observation's z-score value is equal to its distance from the mean, in standard deviation units.

---

# Transforming Distributions

Here is a histogram of our life expectancy data.
&lt;img src="continuous_l1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-15-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

We are going to create a new variable called `life_expectancy_zscore` using the linear function described on the previous slide.

```r
who$life_expectancy_zscore &lt;- (who$life_expectancy - mean(who$life_expectancy))/sd(who$life_expectancy)
```

---
# Transforming Distributions

Let's look at the first few transformed values.

```r
head(who$life_expectancy_zscore)
```

```
## [1] -0.8145996  0.7804065  0.5350210 -2.4096058  0.5350210  0.5350210
```


```r
## Histogram of the new z-scores
hist(who$life_expectancy_zscore)
```

&lt;img src="continuous_l1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-18-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

We now have a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1.

---
# Transforming Distributions

An important note about standardizing a distribution is that it changes the mean and standard deviation, but **does not change the overall shape.**

&lt;img src="continuous_l1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-19-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
---
# Distributional Shape
## Skewness
* Not all distributions in the real world are symmetrical. Often they have asymmetry or **skewness**.
* Skewness describes how much a distribution is "bunched up" to the right or left.

&lt;img src="continuous_l1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-20-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

* Positive Skew - Distribution is skewed to the left with a "positive-pointing finger."
* Negative Skew - Distribution is skewed to the right with a "negative-pointing finger."

---
# Distributional Shape
## Kurtosis

* Kurtosis describes how much the values concentrate around the center (the "pointiness" of a distribution)
 + Leptokurtic distributions have more values around the center and have a "taller" peak.
 + Platykurtic distributions do not have a prominent peak and have a flatter top.
 
&lt;img src="continuous_l1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-21-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
---
# Moments of a distribution
1. Mean
`$$\mu = \frac{\Sigma(x_i)}{N}$$`
2. Variance
`$$\sigma^2 = \frac{\Sigma(X_i-\mu)^2}{N}$$`
3. Skewness
`$$skewness(X) = \frac{1}{N\sigma^3}\Sigma(X_i-\mu)^3$$`
4. Kurtosis
`$$kurtosis(X) = \frac{1}{N\sigma^4}\Sigma(X_i-\mu)^4-3$$`

We do not need to know how to calculate skew and kurtosis but we do need to have a sense of how to interpret them.

---
# Evaluating Skewness and Kurtosis

* Skewness and kurtosis can be evaluated visually and summarized quantitatively.

  + Positive skew (skewed to the left) `\(\rightarrow\)` Skewness &gt; 0
  + Negative skew (skewed to the right) `\(\rightarrow\)` Skewness &gt; 0

  + Leptokurtic `\(\rightarrow\)` Kurtosis &gt; 0
  + Platykurtic `\(\rightarrow\)` Kurtosis &lt; 0
  

Note: In this course we will focus visual analysis for severe skew or kurtosis. Future courses will discuss how to correct for skew or kurtosis, as necessary. 

---
# Summarizing Data

* Here is a density plot of the WHO life expectancy data for 2015. 
* How would you characterize the distribution?

&lt;img src="continuous_l1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-22-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

* Is there severe skew?
* Is there severe kurtosis?

---
# Summarizing Data

The distribution of life expectancy has a slightly negative skew and no excess kurtosis. The skewness and kurtosis are not severe.
&lt;img src="continuous_l1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-23-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

The &lt;span style="color: red;"&gt;mean&lt;/span&gt; national life expectancy in 2015 was **71.62** years.

The &lt;span style="color: blue;"&gt;median&lt;/span&gt; national life expectancy in 2015 was **74** years.

* Due to the slight skew, the median appears to better capture the "center" of our distribution.

---
# Visualizing Distributions

Although histograms and density plots are useful for evaluating the shape of a distribution, they do not efficiently summarize the central tendency and variance.

.pull-left[
Q2(Median) = 2.6350
Q1 = 1.75
Q3 = 3.00
IQR = 1.25
Lower Inner Fence : Q1 – 1.5*IQR = -0.125
Upper Inner Fence : Q3 + 1.5*IQR = 4.875
Lower adjacent value = smallest value &gt; lower fence
Upper adjacent value = largest value &lt; upper fence
]

.pull-right[
&lt;img src="boxplot.png" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
]

The boxplot also displays any values beyond the lower and upper adjacent values (outliers) with a *.
